# Task-Management-App
A simple task management application built with Backbone.js and jQuery. This app allows users to add, edit, delete, and filter tasks while persisting data using localStorage.

Edit Tasks: Modify existing tasks dynamically.

Delete Tasks: Remove tasks from the list.

Mark as Completed: Toggle task completion status.

Filter Tasks: View tasks based on their status (All, Active, Completed).

Persist Data: Tasks are stored in localStorage, ensuring they remain available after a page refresh.

# Technologies Used

Backbone.js (Models, Collections, Views, and Routers)

jQuery (DOM manipulation, event handling)

Underscore.js (Templating and utility functions)

Backbone.LocalStorage (Data persistence)

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

# Work in Progress ðŸš§

The task display feature is still being refined. Some UI elements may not render correctly when tasks are updated.

Future improvements will include better UI styling and API integration.
